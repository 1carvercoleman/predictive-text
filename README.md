# predictive-text
Uses the C++ "map" data structure to output predicted text from training text file.

## Usage
A training file is already included (Trump.txt is most of Donald Trump's speech in Iowa on January 30th, 2020), but any text file can be used. Usage is as follows:
```
make
./text-predictor [training filename] [Output length (Ex: 100)]
```
This program is very entertaining because you can generate text that sounds like your training data. Here's an example output using Trump.txt and 100 output length:
